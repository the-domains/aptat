"In our opinion, the conditions essential to the art of acting are the following, and should be made the object of a methodical investigation:

a To stimulate a process of self-revelation, going back as far as the subconscious, yet canalizing this stimulus in order to obtain the required reaction, 

b To be able to articulate this process, discipline it and convert it into signs. In concrete terms, this means to construct a score whose notes are tiny elements of contact, reactions to the stimuli of the outside world: what we call "give and take", 

c To eliminate from the creative process the resistances and obstacles caused by one's own organism, both physical and psychic (the two forming a whole)." from **Jerzy Grotowski....**
