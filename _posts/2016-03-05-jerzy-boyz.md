I very much admire the core ideas that i have learned from gratowski's experiments. They were written in the mid twentieth century and so they use very male-centric language which i degender and recreate - considering all humans respective "actors" of whatever roles they are destined and/or both determined to play...

Jerzy Gratowski  **"Theatre director and theoretician, educator, creator of acting methods. Born in 1933 in the city of Rzeszów in southeastern Poland and died in 1999 in Pontedera, Italy. He is considered to have been one of the greatest reformers of 20th century theatre." \***

"In our opinion, the conditions essential to the art of acting are the following, and should be made the object of a methodical investigation:

a    To stimulate a process of self-revelation, going back as far as the subconscious, yet canalizing this stimulus in order to obtain the required reaction, 

b    To be able to articulate this process, discipline it and convert it into signs. In concrete terms, this means to construct a score whose notes are tiny elements of contact, reactions to the stimuli of the outside world: what we call "give and take", 

c    To eliminate from the creative process the resistances and obstacles caused by one's own organism, both physical and psychic (the two forming a whole)." from Jerzy Gratowski - "Towards a Poor Man's Theater"
